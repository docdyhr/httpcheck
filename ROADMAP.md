  - `output_formatter.py` - Result formatting and display
  - `notification.py` - System notifications
- [ ] **High Priority:** Create a proper package structure with `__init__.py`
- [ ] **Medium Priority:** Implement a class-based approach for the main functionality

### Essential Features (3 weeks)

## Development Approach

### Prioritization Criteria
1. **User Impact:** Features that directly improve user experience
2. **Complexity:** Balance between development effort and feature value
3. **Dependencies:** Some features require others to be implemented first

### Release Process
1. **Alpha:** Internal testing with core developers
2. **Beta:** Limited external testing with early adopters
3. **Release Candidate:** Feature complete with focus on bug fixing
4. **General Availability:** Public release with documentation and support

### Contribution Guidelines
- All code should include appropriate unit tests
- Documentation should be updated with each feature
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Each PR should address a specific feature or bug

### Status Tracking
This roadmap will be updated monthly to reflect progress and any reprioritization based on user feedback or technical constraints.
