## [1.3.1] - 2025-06-27

### üîí Security
- **CRITICAL**: Replaced pickle with JSON for TLD cache serialization to eliminate security vulnerability
- Fixed potential code injection risk in cache deserialization

### ‚ú® Added
- Comprehensive unit test suite with pytest framework
- Basic test coverage for core functionality (URL validation, file parsing, TLD management)
- Modern `pyproject.toml` configuration with proper dependency management
- Separate optional dependency groups for macOS, development, and build tools

### üîß Changed
- **BREAKING**: TLD cache format changed from pickle (`.pickle`) to JSON (`.json`)
  - Existing pickle cache files will be automatically refreshed with JSON format
  - No user action required - migration is automatic
- Consolidated fragmented requirements files into clean dependency structure
- Improved error handling for JSON cache operations

### üóëÔ∏è Removed
- Removed unused development dependencies from core requirements
- Eliminated redundant and outdated package versions
- Cleaned up duplicate and unnecessary imports

### üì¶ Dependencies
**Runtime Dependencies (minimized):**
- `requests>=2.32.0` - HTTP client library
- `tabulate>=0.9.0` - Table formatting
- `tqdm>=4.67.0` - Progress bars

**Optional Dependencies:**
- `macos`: macOS menu bar app support (rumps, pyobjc-*)
- `dev`: Development tools (pytest, pylint, coverage)
- `build`: Build tools for macOS app (py2app)

### üß™ Testing
- Added comprehensive test suite covering:
  - URL validation and normalization
  - File input parsing with comments
  - TLD cache management and JSON format
  - HTTP request mocking and error handling
  - Output formatting in different modes
- Configured pytest with coverage reporting (target >70%)

### üìö Documentation
- Updated project documentation to reflect security improvements
- Added development workflow documentation
- Created comprehensive development plan for v1.4.0 refactoring
- Enhanced AI assistant guidance with current priorities

### üèóÔ∏è Development
- Maintained pylint score of 10.0/10 throughout refactoring
- Established foundation for upcoming v1.4.0 modularization
- Improved code organization without breaking changes
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### üîÑ Migration Notes
- **TLD Cache**: Users with existing `.httpcheck/tld_cache.pickle` files will see automatic migration to `tld_cache.json` format on first run
- **Dependencies**: Users should update their installation:
  ```bash
  # For core functionality
  pip install httpcheck

  # For macOS menu bar app
  pip install httpcheck[macos]

  # For development
  pip install httpcheck[dev]
  ```
