```

### Configuration File Format
```toml
[defaults]
timeout = 10
retries = 3
user_agent = "httpcheck/1.4.0"

[output]

```

### New CLI Features
```bash
# JSON output
httpcheck --output json example.com

# Custom headers
httpcheck -H "Authorization: Bearer token" example.com

# Rate limiting
httpcheck --rate-limit 5 @domains.txt

# Configuration file
httpcheck --config ~/.httpcheck.conf example.com

# CSV export
httpcheck --output csv --file results.csv @domains.txt
```

## Quality Standards
