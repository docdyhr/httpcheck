- Test coverage reporting functional

### 2. **Remove Redundant Requirements Files**
- **Deleted Files:**
  - `requirements.txt`
  - `requirements-core.txt`
  - `requirements-macos.txt`
- **Updated Files:**
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Now uses pyproject.toml

  - `setup.py` - Removed requirements.txt from DATA_FILES
- **Result:** Single source of truth for dependencies in `pyproject.toml`

### 3. **Clean Up Unused Python Files**
- **Deleted:**
  - `httpcheck_backup.py`
  - `httpcheck_old.py`
- **Reorganized:**
  - Moved `test_menubar.py` to `scripts/test_menubar.py` (test utility)

### 4. **Update Documentation**
- **CLAUDE.md** - Updated to reflect completed tasks
- **TODO.md** - Marked Week 1 and Week 2-3 tasks as completed
- **DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md** - Updated progress tracking

## ðŸ“Š Current Project Status

### Code Quality
- âœ… **Pylint Score:** 10.0/10 maintained
- âœ… **Test Coverage:** 82% (exceeds 70% target)
- âœ… **All tests passing:** 40 passed, 1 skipped

### Architecture
- âœ… **Modularization:** Already completed (ahead of schedule!)
- âœ… **Package Structure:** Clean separation of concerns
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility:** Maintained

### Security
- âœ… **Pickle â†’ JSON:** Already migrated (security vulnerability resolved)
- âœ… **Dependencies:** Consolidated and audited

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Week 4 - Testing & Quality)

Since we're ahead of schedule (Week 2-3 modularization already done), we can proceed to:

1. **Enhance Test Coverage**
   - Add edge case tests
   - Improve integration testing
   - Add performance benchmarks

2. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Add comprehensive module docstrings
   - Create API documentation
   - Update user guide

3. **CI/CD Improvements**
   - Ensure GitHub Actions work with new structure
   - Add automated release process
   - Set up code coverage badges

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Run full test suite in CI to verify GitHub Actions work
   - Consider adding pre-commit hooks for code quality
   - Create a CHANGELOG entry for these improvements

2. **Technical Debt:**
   - The effective_tld_names.dat file (217KB) should be moved to ~/.httpcheck/
   - Consider adding type hints to improve code maintainability
   - Look into the skipped test (test_load_from_cache_json)

3. **Feature Development:**
   - Ready to implement JSON/CSV output formats (Phase 3)
   - Configuration file support could be prioritized
