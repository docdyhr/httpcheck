The updated TODO list now aligns with the roadmap I provided, prioritizing tasks based on:

1. **User Impact**: Features that provide immediate value to users are placed higher in the list
2. **Complexity**: More complex items are given appropriate priority based on effort-to-value ratio
3. **Dependencies**: Items that serve as foundations for other features are prioritized accordingly

The High Priority section focuses on code organization and essential features that will have the greatest immediate impact on maintainability and user experience. These items align with the Version 1.4.0 milestone in the roadmap.

Medium Priority items correspond to the Version 1.5.0 milestone features, which build upon the foundation established by the high-priority items.

Future Enhancements align with Version 1.6.0 and beyond, representing more advanced capabilities that will transform httpcheck from a simple status checker into a comprehensive monitoring solution.

The Completed section acknowledges the significant work already done, maintaining continuity with previous development efforts.

This structured approach ensures that development efforts are focused on the most impactful features first, while still maintaining a vision for the project's long-term evolution.
